# Fusion Theory (Formalized in Coq)

Fusion Theory proposes a non-commutative, non-associative,
non-idempotent generative algebra as a minimal formal
foundation for non-repetitive structural evolution.

This repository contains a lightweight formalization in Coq.

## 1. Motivation

Most foundational mathematical structures rely on:

- Identity
- Associativity
- Commutativity
- Idempotence (in certain contexts)
- Fixed-point stability

Fusion Theory explores a radically different premise:

> Structural evolution without repetition.

Instead of composition as aggregation,
Fusion is defined as generative transformation.

---

## 2. Core Idea

We define a binary operation:

    ⊕ : S → S → S

Subject to:

- Non-commutativity  
- Non-associativity  
- Non-idempotence  

Fusion is not union, not addition, not composition.
It is structural mutation.

## 3. Dynamical Evolution

State evolution is defined as:

    Sₙ₊₁ = Sₙ ⊕ Δₙ

with a non-repetition axiom:

    n ≠ m → Sₙ ≠ Sₘ

This encodes strictly non-cyclic evolution.

---

## 4. Physical Interpretation (Exploratory)

A projection:

    observable : S → ℝ

allows modeling of non-exact conservation:

    observable(Sₙ₊₁) ≠ observable(Sₙ)

This is not a physical claim,
but a structural formal possibility.

---

## 5. Philosophy (Minimal Statement)

Fusion Theory does not assume:

- Fixed identity
- Exact repetition
- Structural closure

It provides a formal sandbox for exploring
non-recurrent generative systems.

---

## 6. Status

This is an experimental formal system.

No claim is made regarding:
- Completeness
- Consistency relative to ZFC
- Physical correctness

The goal is structural exploration.

## 7. Future Directions

- Category-theoretic reformulation
- Higher-type extensions
- Homotopy Type Theory interpretation
- Physical model refinement
